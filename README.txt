This is a coding challenge for Shift7 Digital for the Entry Level Front-End Developer position.

This was to show some of my skills in regards to Front-End. 

I want to say that this was a challenge for me, and I loved every minute of it. This has taught me some new things, and helped me think outside of the box.

Also, this has shown me that I want to become a Front-End Developer so I can gain more skill because I have a lot of learning to do, and I'm excited to learn as much as I can!
